# Python-Snippets
Helpful snippets to work with Python

## What are these snippets?
These snippets are helpful tools that I've developed to aid my own workflow. I'll try to include some use cases wherever needed/possible.

## Snippets
### Clipboard2Dict.py
This snippets takes your clipboard (from a tabular format (e.g., Excel)) and turns it into a dictionary. The resulting dictionary is returned to your clipboard.

For example, this table:
| col1 | col2 |
|------|------|
| a    | 1    |
| b    | 2    |

Would return the following dictionary: {'a':1, 'b':2}.
